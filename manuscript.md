## Why should we predict and forecast species interaction networks?

Networks underpin our understanding of key ecological processes
[@Pascual2006EcoNet; @Heleno2014EcoNet], and in the recent years our interest
has shifted towards understanding their structure over space
[@Trojelsgaard2016EcoNet; @Baiser2019EcoRul]. But despite the importance of
understanding this structure, the raw data to do it, *i.e.* exhaustive lists of
species interactions at sampled locations, remains extremely scarce. This is,
quite simply, because sampling ecological interactions is extremely difficult
[@Jordano2016SamNet], and this defficiency in sampling of interactions can lead
to biases in our estimate of the sampling of network structure
[@deAguiar2019RevBia]. As many ecological systems are entering their "long now"
[@Carpenter2002EcoFut], where contemporary actions will have long-term,
low-predictibility consequences, it is a moral imperative to develop a roadmap
that would enable prediction (for the present) and forecasting (for the future)
of network structure, and of the processes it encodes [@McCann2007ProBio;
@Seibold2018NecMul; @Thompson2012FooWeb].
