## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

Interaction strength, unlike the qualitative presence/absence interaction, is the quantification of an interaction. It can be seen as its relative importance [@Heleno2014EcoNet] or the direct effect of one species on another over a period of time [@Wootten1997EstTes]. Interaction strength can be expressed by a multitude of different metrics, generally depending on the type of interaction, for example trophic interaction versus plant-pollinator interctions, and the study objectives [@Berlow2004IntStr, Wootten2005MeaInt] but the general measure is usually expressed as a frequency or biomass [@Heleno2014EcoNet] over a period of time. While interaction strength might take multiple forms, it can generally be divided into two main categories as suggested by @Berlow2004IntStr: it can either be seen as the strength of an individual species-to-species link or as the effect that the changes in one species has on the dynamic of other species or on the whole community. Despite the multiple possibilities, one recurring observation throughout many studies is that networks are often composed of many weak links and few strong links [@Berlow2004IntStr]. 

The additional layer of information brought by interaction strength to the underlying network topology is an important one. Indeed, the distribution of interaction strength within a network is important for its stability [@Neutel2002StaReaa, @Ruiter1995EnePat], it influences the ecosystemic functions arising from it [@Duffy2002BioEco, @Montoya2003FooWeb] and could improve our development of multispecies model [@Wootten2005MeaInt]. Seeing interaction strength within a network as energy fluxes could also possibly lead to its integration within a the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) framekwork, which could in return improve even more our understanding of community dynamics and ecosystem functionning [@Barnes2018EneFlua]. 

It remains that the analysis of interaction strength from empirical estimation is highly prone to biases since network of interaction strength are usually lumped together, making it difficult to differentiate the strength in per-individual interactions from strength of a whole species interaction [@Wells2013SpeInt]. Empirical estimation of interaction strength is still crucial [@Novak2008EstNon], but is a hard task to do from natural communities [@Wootten1997EstTesa, @Sala2002ComDis, @Wootten2005MeaInt], espically because of the large number of species composing communities, the multiple paths species can affect one another and the possibility that the interaction strength functions might not have a linear response [@Wootten2005MeaInt]. Furthermore, interaction strength is highly variable and context dependent. It might be prone to variation due to indirect effect and be density-dependent, it could vary with the spatial and temporal scale and could also vary with community compositionÂ [@Wootten2005MeaInt]. Thus its prediction (inference?) is a key step and has the possibility to be done with relatively easily accesible data like body size, abundance, density and metabolic rates [@Berlow2004IntStr].

**I would argue for a certain homogenization of interaction strength between different types of network (interaction) to make comparison/analysis easier. Relevant? How? **

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?
