## Why should we predict and forecast species interaction networks?

Networks of species interactionss underpin our understanding of key ecological
processes [@Pascual2006EcoNet; @Heleno2014EcoNet]. Although they have initially
be used to describe the interactions *within* a community, our interest in the
last decade has shifted towards understanding their structure and their
variation over space [@Trojelsgaard2016EcoNet; @Baiser2019EcoRul], and
established network ecology as an important emerging component of biogeography
and macroecology. But our understanding of network structure, and in particular
across space, is limited by availability of data. Characterizing a network
requires an exhaustive list of species interactions at the sampled location, and
these data remain extremely scarce. This is because sampling ecological
interactions is extremely difficult [@Jordano2016SamNet]; in turn, the
difficulty of sampling interactions can lead to biases in our estimate of the
sampling of network structure [@deAguiar2019RevBia]. As many ecological systems,
ecological networks have entered their "long now" [@Carpenter2002EcoFut], where
contemporary actions will have long-term, low-predictibility consequences,
sometimes over centuries [@Burkle2013PlaInt]. It is therfore imperative to
develop a roadmap that would enable prediction (for the present) and forecasting
(for the future) of network structure [@McCann2007ProBio; @Seibold2018NecMul],
of the processes it encodes [@Thompson2012FooWeb], that can account for the
spatial, temporal, and climate change dimensions [@Burkle2011FutPla]. In this
paper, we adopt a question-driven approach to identify opportunities,
roadblocks, and tools that are part of this research agenda.
