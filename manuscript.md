1. Pollinator-Plant conservation  
   Most flowering plant rely on animal pollinators for reproduction. The
   persistance of many rare plants is therefore dependent on the presence and
   abundance of these pollinator species. Because these focal plants are rare,
   the animal pollinators they rely on mainly feed on other more common plant
   species. Consequently, the persistance of rare plant species depends on the
   persistance of more common plant species in the community. Therefore,
   management of rare plant species would benefit from a complete portrait of
   the pollinator-plant network. For the same reasons, we could also argue that
   the long-term persistance of pollinator species depends on the presence and
   abundance of other pollinator they share plant host.

1. Zoonotic disease spillover  
   Many infectious diseases originate from animal. The prediction of potential
   disease transmission across species (including humans) is therefore of major
   concern for public health. Because many animals are changing their range in
   response to warming and other anthropological changes, species that never
   co-occured will encounter. This will create many opportunities for viral
   spillover events. Only by simultaniously identifying potential hosts and
   accuratly predicting species range shifts, we will be able to forecast the
   emergences of new infectious diseases and help prevent public health hazards.

# Interactions

**Box 2: Machine Learning Illustration**

## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?
They do (Species pool/richness vary in space; Intrasp variation; Environment can influence interactions)

Actually, not so much (Ecological network share similar structure (connectance, link distribution); Species conserve role; etc) 

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

**Box 3: Forecasting**

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?
