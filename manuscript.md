## What is the paper about?

## Who would benefit from it?

## Why do we need to predict interactions between species?

**Point 1: we don’t have data, don’t pretend we do!**  
*Eltonian shortfall.* We don’t have much data about species interactions, so predictions could help fill in the gaps. 
*Co-occurrence is not interaction.* Please stop piling species on distribution models and saying they account for interactions!
**Point 2: our planet is changing and the predictions can help us understand what’s going to happen**
*Things are changing.* Interactions change over time from anthropological impact, climate change, etc.
*Applications.* We use our knowledge about species interaction to understand from the production of food and the conservation of freshwater, to the understanding of emerging diseases. As we know better about these interactions and how they are going to change, we have enough arguments to communicate to decision makers and the scientific community what future risks await us and how to mitigate them.

**Box 2: Machine Learning Illustration**

## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

**Box 3: Forecasting**

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?
