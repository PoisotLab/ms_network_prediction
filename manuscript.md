# A primer on predictive (network) ecology

## What are the most important properties of networks to predict?

## What is the added value of using machine learning?

## How do we fit a predictive model?

## How do we validate a predictive model?

## How do we propagate uncertainty through a predictive model?

## How do we determine what interaction networks are feasible?

# Interactions

**Box 2: Machine Learning Illustration**

## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?
They do (Species pool/richness vary in space; Intrasp variation; Environment can influence interactions)

Actually, not so much (Ecological network share similar structure (connectance, link distribution); Species conserve role; etc) 

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

**Box 3: Forecasting**

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?
