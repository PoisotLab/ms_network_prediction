# A primer on predictive (network) ecology

## What are the most important properties of networks to predict?

## What is the added value of using machine learning?

Many ecological and evolutionary processes underlie species interactions 
and the structure of their ecological networks [e.g. @Vazquez2009UniPat; @Segar2020RolEvo]. 
It can thus be difficult to choose relevant variables and model species 
interactions networks explicitly. Machine learning methods are particularly 
useful in predicting ecological networks as they can uncover hidden and 
complex relationships from vast amount of ecological data. Machine learning, 
including deep learning, encompasses a broad variety of techniques applied 
with or without human supervision. These techniques are typically more 
flexible and performant than standard statistical methods, and can achieve 
a very high level of accuracy in predictive and classification tasks in a 
relatively short amount of time [e.g. @Cutler2007RanFor; @Krizhevsky2017ImaCla]. 
Machine learning is emerging as the new standard in computational ecology in 
general [@Olden2008MacLea; @Christin2019AppDee], and in network ecology in 
particular [@Bohan2017NexGlo], as long as sufficient relevant data is available.

A promising application of machine learning in natural sciences is Scientific 
Machine Learning (SciML), a novel and very powerful predictive method that 
combines machine learning with mechanistic models [@Chuang2018AdvCon; @Rackauckas2020UniDif]. 
SciML may require smaller amounts of data than more traditional machine learning 
methods, in addition to being more interpretable than the black box of machine 
learning. Although SciML has not yet been applied in ecology, we believe it 
could prove very useful in the near future to predict ecological networks 
with relatively small amounts of data using existing process-based models.
