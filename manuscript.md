**Box 2: Machine Learning Illustration**

## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?


**P2** 
Variation in interaction networks over space arises through changes in species composition and realised interactions [@Poisot2012TheDis].

"These changes are the results of local processes" [@Poisot2015BeySpe]
How network structure may change on macroecological scale [@Baiser2019EcoRul]
Some empirical studies [@Baiser2012GeoVar, @Cirtwill2015LatGra]


**P1** 
A lot of early ecological network research have focused on finding generalities in network structure across systems [@Dunne2006TheNet].

Species Richness -> Connectance -> Everything else! [@Macdonald2020RevThe, @Brose2004UniSpa]
Species role are conserved over spatial scale [@Baker2014SpeRol]
Functional role composition did not change across space [@Dehling2020SimCom]
Food webs shared a common structural backbone [@Mora2018IdeCom]

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

**Box 3: Forecasting**

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?
