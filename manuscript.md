Many approaches to understand the relationship between ecological network structure and feasibility. These can be divided into structural and dynamic approaches. Structural approaches [@allesinaStabilityCriteriaComplex2012] only consider the topology of the metaweb (although the criteria for “structural” stability models was originally derived from fixed-point stability criteria for the generalized LV model). Dynamical approaches consider the dynamics of energy flow in a food-web [@delmasSimulationsBiomassDynamics2017]. Further ‘stability’ and ‘feasibility’ have different dimensions---resilience to environmental change, extinction, etc [@dominguez-garciaUnveilingDimensionsStability2019].

# Interactions

**Box 2: Machine Learning Illustration**

## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred?

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions?

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

**Box 3: Forecasting**

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?
