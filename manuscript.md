**Box 2: Machine Learning Illustration**

## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?

Forecasting how climate change will alter biodiversity is crucial for maximising conservation outcomes. On the one hand, we know that biotic interactions influence the distribution of species at different scale [@Araujo2007TheImp, @Pigot2013SpeInt]. On the other hand, most existing models to predict the future distribution of species ignore interactions [@Urban2016ImpFor]. Species range shifts and phenological adaptations will inevitably create spatiotemporal mistmatches and affect encounter rates between interacting species [@Gilman2010FraCom]. New links will also be created between species that are not currently co-occuring [@Gilman2010FraCom]. Only by forecasting how species will interact can we hope to have an accurate portrait of how biodiversity will be distributed under the future climate. 

Not only this, but how biodiversity is structured influence the functioning of the whole ecosystem, community stability and persistance [@Thompson2012FooWeb, @Stouffer2010UndFoo]. Will climate change impact the distribution of network properties (e.g. connectance)? If so, which regions or species groups need special conservation efforts? These overarching questions are yet to be answered [but see @Albouy2013FroPro; @Kortsch2015CliCha; @Hattab2016ForFin]. We believe that this roadmap towards forecasting ecological networks provide useful guidelines to ultimatly being able to predict more accuratly how climate change will affect the different dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
