The acquisition of biodiversity and environmental data has tremendously 
increased over the past decades thanks to the rise of citizen science 
[@Dickinson2010CitSci] and of novel technology [@Stephenson2020TecAdv], 
including wireless sensors [@Porter2005WirSen], DNA monitoring 
[@Creer2016EcoSF], and satellite remote sensing [@Skidmore2015AgrBio; @Lausch2016LinEar]. 
Standard practices in data integration and quality control [@Kissling2018BuiEss] and in 
Next-generation biomonitoring [NGB; @Makiola2020KeyQue] are being set, with favorable 
consequences on our ability to make reliable predictions of many ecosystem properties 
and components. Open access databases, such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) (for biodiversity data), 
[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (for taxonomic and genomics data), 
[TreeBASE](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html) (for phylogenetics data), 
[CESTE](https://icestes.github.io/) [@Jeliazkov2020GloDat] (for metacommunity ecology 
and species traits data), and [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) 
(for bioclimatic data) contain millions of high-quality data that can be integrated and 
used to monitor and model biodiversity at the global scale. Regarding species interactions 
data, [Mangal](https://mangal.io/#/) is perhaps the most comprehensive open database of 
published ecological networks [@Poisot2016ManMak], whereas 
[GloBI](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/about) is an extensive database 
of realized and potential species interactions [@Poelen2014GloBio].

The rise of computing power, along with recent advances in machine learning techniques 
and applications (see @Christin2019AppDee for the use of deep learning in ecology), 
enable us to manipulate a very large number of data from different sources. Accurate 
predictions of ecological networks across space can thus be generated by integrating 
various high-quality, open access datasets, such as the ones archived in the abovementioned 
databases, if we use predictive methods appropriately. Moreover, ongoing developments in 
the field of artificial intelligence are aimed at using deep learning more efficiently in 
low-data regimes [e.g. @Antoniou2018DatAug] and with unbalanced datasets [@Chawla2010DatMin]. 
Considering the current biases in network ecology [@Poisot2020EnvBia] and the scarcity of data 
of species interactions, the prediction of ecological networks will undoubtedly benefit from these improvements. 
The advancement of prediction techniques coupled with a movement towards standardising data 
collection protocols (e.g. @Perez-Harguindeguy2013NewHan for plant functional traits) and  
metadata (e.g. [DarwinCore](https://www.tdwg.org)), which would facilitate interoperability and 
integration of datasets, as well as a growing interest at the government level [@Scholes2012BuiGlo] 
paints a positive picture for the prediction of networks in the coming years.
