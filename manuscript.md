## What is the paper about?

## Who would benefit from it?

## Why do we need to predict interactions between species?

## Why predict networks before interactions?

## What is currently limiting our ability to predict network structure?

* As this will probably play a part in up setting the tone/concept for the ms 
I guess it makes sense to make sure we address the need for ‘tools’ (as 
granted by the all seeing light of ML) That being said might be nice to bring 
in a general point for each section - if at all possible...

The scarcity of data on species interactions is certainly one of the biggest 
barriers in predicting network structure. Machine learning methods, especially deep 
learning methods, need a lot of data. Compounding the scarcity of data the 
data that are available are biased toward food webs and select mutualistic 
networks, and could prove to be a limiting factor when trying to understand or
predict networks of *other* interaction types. A better understanding of how 
different types of networks differ from each another would serve as a starting 
point, although this in itself could be a potential hurdle 
[@Michalska-Smith2019TelEco].

The scale at which we are able to predict networks are currently limited to 
the resolution of the data available. Regarding levels of organisation our 
understanding of individual based networks is still in its infancy 
[@Guimaraes2020StrEco] and acts as a 'lower-limit' at which we 
would be able to predict networks. On the note of scale, the resolution of 
environmental (or landscape) data would also limit our ability to predict 
networks at finer scales, although current trends in e.g. remote sensing would 
suggest that with time this would become less of a hindrance.
