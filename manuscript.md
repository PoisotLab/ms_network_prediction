## What is a species interaction?

The coexistence of species does not necessarily preclude that they will
interact [@Blanchet2020CooNot], however (at least for *direct* interactions) 
we would require species to co-occur in space and time [@Walther2010ComEco].  
The intrinsically diverse and complex nature of species interactions 
[something we could address in the glossary perhaps?] makes 
it difficult to accurately describe and collect data that are accurate and 
comprehensive. However, a *mechanistic* understanding of what 
determines if and how species will interact can be leveraged when trying to 
predict interactions when data are incomplete or missing.

* Do we continue on a tangent about the 'ecological aspect' - so in a way
  introducing but not stepping on the toes of the next points
* Or do we do a swivel and go with how we mathematically would go about 
  describing an interaction - which I guess would entail discussing the potential value that an interaction could take? 


## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

## What does interaction strength mean?

## How are interaction strengths actually inferred? 

## Could we use hypergraphs and multi-layer networks to predict more interactions? 

# Network predictions must have a spatial component

**Everything is connected figure**

## How much do networks vary over space?

## How do we predict what the species pool at a particular location is?

## How could predictions for individual species, such as those used by IPBES/IUCN, be improved by considering ecological interactions?

## What is the spatial scale suitable for the prediction of species interactions?

# Giving a temporal component to network predictions requires forecasting

## What data do we need to turn a predictive model into a forecasting model?

## How can we validate a forecast, and would hindcasting help?

## What ecological knowledge would forecasting bring?
