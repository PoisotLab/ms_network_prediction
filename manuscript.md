1. Pollinator-Plant conservation  
   Most flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for reproduction. The
   persistence of many rare plants is therefore dependent on the presence and
   abundance of these pollinator species. Because these focal plants are rare,
   the animal pollinators they rely on also feed on other more common plant
   species [@gibson2006PolWebs]. Consequently, the persistence of rare plants
   indirectly depends on the persistence of more common plant species in the
   community. Therefore, management of rare plant species would benefit from a
   complete portrait of the pollinator-plant network. Identifying and protecting
   the primary food sources of key pollinators would result in more effective
   conservation plans. By the same reasoning, the long-term persistence of rare
   pollinator species depends on the presence and abundance of other more common
   pollinators they share plant hosts with.

1. Zoonotic disease spillover  
   Many infectious diseases originate from animal. The prediction of potential
   disease transmission across species (including humans) is therefore of major
   concern for public health. Because many animals are changing their range in
   response to anthropological changes, species that never co-occurred will
   encounter. This will create many opportunities for viral spillover events
   [@Johnson2020GloShi]. Only by simultaneously identifying potential hosts and
   accurately predicting species range shifts, we will be able to forecast the
   emergence of new infectious diseases, predict potential spillover events, and
   help prevent public health hazards.
