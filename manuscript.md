## Why do we need to predict interactions between species?

Ecosystems are build up by a set of species that interact directly or indirectly 
through elements from their common environment. These interactions form complex 
networks that structure ecological communities and maintain ecosystem functions 
[@Landi2018ComSta; @Albrecht2018PlaAni]. The understanding of interactions is 
therefore crucial for ecosystem management, but also for many other aspects of
biodiversity. For instance, it is well known that ecosystem functions lead to
services that are related to basic issues of health and the economy of humans, 
like pathogens transmission, food security, or the availability of freshwater. 
But with a changing world that includes a high rate of biodiversity loss, land 
transformation, and the worldwide increase in temperature, researchers are worried 
about how to protect human lives and improve life quality in different countries, 
having into account the measure of the change in the world in the following years.  

However, we are far from having a comprehensive knowledge about biodiversity,
especially regarding ecological interactions. Although we have seen a growing
number of records for species occurrences, this growth is much slower for
ecological interactions, especially because interactions are hard to capture and
because of forbidden links [@Jordano2016SamNet]. This knowledge gap motivated a
variety of approaches to deal with interactions in ecological research based on
assumptions that are not always true, such as the correlation between
co-occurrence and interaction. Although sometimes this is a valid simplification
to model communities, it is known that co-occurrence is only one of the elements
necessary for an interaction to occur [@Blanchet2020CooNot]. Other elements that
contribute to the realization of an interaction are abundance and traits
matching in space and time, and the combination of these elements allow us to
infer potential from realized interactions and empirical data about populations
[@Poisot2016StrPro]. 

Because interactions carry a lot of ecological and evolutive information about
biodiversity, predicted links can help us to have a more complete framework to
understand processes and future rearrangements of nature. Moreover,
using reliable current data for making predictions about how ecosystems will 
change over time will give us stronger arguments that could be communicated 
to decision-makers and the scientific community about what are future environmental 
risks awaiting and how to mitigate them [@Kindsvater2018OveDat].
