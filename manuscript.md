## What is a species interaction?

## How do we predict how species that have never co-occurred will interact?

The probability of the realization of an ecological interaction depend on
co-occurrence in space and time, abundance and traits matching
[@Poisot2014SpeWhy; @Pichler2019MacLea]. Given two species that co-occur, a
neutral approach to probabilistic interactions would be based on abundances and
"neutralize" the effect of traits matching [@Canard2012EmeStr]. In this case we
can infer the probability of an interaction to occur by chance, just because two
species are abundant enough to bump into each other, and should be a good
parameter against which we could test other factors that limit the realization
of an interaction.   

However, some proxies can be used to make more accurate predictions of potential
ecological interactions. For instance, functional traits are good such proxies
because they are highly selected by ecological interactions and determine
forbidden links (such as the mechanical impossibility of a bird to consume seeds
larger than its beak). The fact that functional traits suffer some kind of
selective pressure and because niches tend to be conserved throughout a
phylogenetic tree, ecological interactions also tend to be conserved, and
therefore we could also use phylogenies to infer pairs of co-occurring species
that could potentially interact [@Gomez2010EcoInt]. In fact, the contribution of
interactions to the phylogenetic match between species is consistent even
through scales [@Poisot2018IntRet] and in neutral models [@Coelho2017NeuBio].  

*Network-based methods*: We can use latent traits of the species (i.e. unmeasured traits inferred from the known network) to predict missing interactions. However, these methods are sensitive to sampling biases and can only be used for species for which we have interaction data.

*The probabilistic approach*: We can combine local traits distributions, local abundances and Everything Elseâ„¢ to infer the probability of interaction at a regional scale as a result of local observations.
